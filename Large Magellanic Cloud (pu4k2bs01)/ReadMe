# Large Magellanic Cloud RGB Composite Generator

This Python script generates RGB composite images of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using FITS files from the Hubble Space Telescope.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [HST APPP LMC Dataset](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/appp/lmc.html)
- **Filters Used**:
  - F814W (Infrared)
  - F606W (Visible)
  - F450W (Blue)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Astropy  

## Usage

1. Place the following FITS files in the project directory:
    - `h_pu4k2bs01_f814w_sci_v20.fits`
    - `h_pu4k2bs01_f606w_sci_v20.fits`
    - `h_pu4k2bs01_f450w_sci_v20.fits`

2. Run the script:

   `lmc_rgb_composite.py`

## Output

- Generates 100 RGB composite images with varying stretch values.
- Each image is automatically saved as a `.jpg` file in the current directory.
