Description:
This is my public GitHub repository showcasing projects and small-scale works in the field of astronomy and astrophysics.

Disclaimer:
The work presented here is not entirely done by me from scratch. While some projects are independently developed, many have been completed with the help of online resources, AI assistants, professors, and reference materials from other platforms working in the field of astrophysics.

As a second-year undergraduate student, whose primary academic focus is not programming, I balance my time between coursework and developing computational skills. Therefore, some of the work here reflects collaborative learning and guided assistance rather than entirely independent efforts.
