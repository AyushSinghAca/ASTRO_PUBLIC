# FITS Image Log Visualization and Saving

This Python script reads image data from a FITS file, applies logarithmic scaling for better visualization, and displays the result using Matplotlib. It also saves the generated image as a PNG file.

The script works with astronomical data stored in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format, commonly used in astronomy and astrophysics.

---

## Dataset

The script requires an input FITS file (for example, example.fits).  
FITS files typically contain astronomical imaging data or tables collected from telescopes or space observatories.

---

## Requirements

Install the following Python libraries before running the script:

- Python 3.x  
- Astropy  
- Matplotlib  
- NumPy  

---

## How It Works

1. Open the FITS file (example.fits). You can change the filename in the script to match your file.  
2. Check HDU info (optional). Displays information about the file’s structure.  
3. Extract image data from the primary HDU.  
4. Close the FITS file after extracting the data.  
5. Apply logarithmic scaling to improve visibility of faint features and handle negative or zero values.  
6. Display the image using the inferno_r colormap.  
7. Save the image as fits_image.png with high resolution.  

---

## Usage

1. Place your FITS file in the working directory and rename it example.fits (or update the filename in the script).  
2. Run the Python script in your environment.

---

## Output

- Displays the FITS image in a window with a colorbar.  
- Saves the image as fits_image.png in the current directory.
